# Welcome

Hi! I am a first-year Computer Science doctoral student at Kumamoto University, Japan, under the guidance of [Prof. Dr.Eng. Masayoshi Aritsugi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2_VONA4AAAAJ), Assistant Prof. Thanda Shwe, and [Assistant Prof. Israel Mendon√ßa dos Santos](https://www.dbms.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/~israel/). My research interests include AI for spatiotemporal time series and continual learning, with applications to finance and sustainability.&#x20;

I am also a faculty member in Business Statistics at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. Prior to joining Kumamoto University, I earned my master's degree in computational mathematics from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Indoneisia, supervised by [Prof. Dr.techn. Mohammad Isa Irawan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c-kbqzEAAAAJ) and [Assoc. Prof. Budi Setiyono](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3LZz96IAAAAJ).

Before joining ITS, I worked as a software engineer at OCBC Bank.

I share my learning journey through blog posts. Judging by the number of grammar mistakes in my posts, you can probably guess how much help I get from ChatGPT :smile:.
