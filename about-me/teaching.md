# Teaching

## Database Management (VS-231316)&#x20;

In Fall 2024, I taught the Database Management course. It focused on the foundations of databases as well as Structured Query Language. We used an open-source tech stack, primarily PostgreSQL as the database system, with DBeaver as the database management tool.\

The main reference textbook was a textbook we developed ourselves. We are currently converting it into a markdown-based online book to make it more accessible.

## Machine Learning (VS-231742)&#x20;

Together with Noviyanti Santoso, Ph.D., we taught the Machine Learning course in Fall 2024. The course began with the basics of machine learning to help students build a strong understanding of the fundamental theories and then progressed to the applications of machine learning in business and finance.
