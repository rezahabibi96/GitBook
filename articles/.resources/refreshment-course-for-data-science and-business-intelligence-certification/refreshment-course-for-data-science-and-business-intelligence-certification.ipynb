    "From this, we know that the dataset contains 7,043 customers with 21 properties. Taking a quick glance at the data, we can notice some properties that are likely of most interest, Churn. By this time, we may come up with several questions, such as:\n",
    "* What proportion of customers have churned?\n",
    "* What are the main reasons customers decide to churn?\n",
    "* How does customer churn affect the company?\n",
    "* How can we prevent more customers from churning?\n",
