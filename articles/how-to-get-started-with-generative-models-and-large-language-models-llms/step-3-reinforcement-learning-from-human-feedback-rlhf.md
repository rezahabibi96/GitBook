# Step 3: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

At the beginning of this year (2025), we were surprised by the release of DeepSeek-R1, which rivals OpenAI’s o1 in its reasoning ability. As many people know, LLMs generate or predict the next human-like word using autoregressive techniques—that is, they predict the most probable word from their vocabulary given the context.

However, when an LLM is given a math problem, it doesn’t make sense to answer solely based on the most probable next word without actual reasoning ability. This is where **Reinforcement Learning** comes in.

In this step, we’ll discuss a guide to help you understand the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning.
