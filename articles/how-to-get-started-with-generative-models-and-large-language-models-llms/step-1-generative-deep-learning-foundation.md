# Step 1: Generative Deep Learning Foundation

## Let’s Start with the First Step

At this stage, it's important to build a solid foundation in generative models before diving deeper into Large Language Models (LLMs).

## <i class="fa-book-open">:book-open:</i> **Generative Deep Learning: Teaching Machines to Paint, Write, Compose, and Play 2nd**

One of the best resources to get started with generative AI is the book "Generative Deep Learning" by David Foster. This book is an excellent introduction to the field of generative models.

### **What They Cover** <a href="#contents" id="contents"></a>

It covers practical implementations of several popular generative models, including:

1. **VAEs** (Variational Autoencoders),
2. **GAN** (Generative Adversarial Network),
3. Autoregressive Models
4. An introduction to Transformers and attention mechanisms

While the book primarily focuses on the image domain, the concepts and techniques introduced are foundational and transferable to other data types, especially text.

It gives a good balance between intuition, practical coding, and light mathematical theory, making it approachable even for those without a strong math background.

### Framework Note

The book uses Tensorflow as its main framework for the hands-on. However, I suggest using PyTorch for the subsequent guides, as it's widely adopted and beginner-friendly. There's good news, a PyTorch implementation of the book is available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/terrence-ou/Generative-Deep-Learning-2nd-Edition-PyTorch-JAX).

### Suggested Reading Path

If you feel overwhelmed by the number of chapters, here’s a recommended path to get the most essential ideas:

* Finish **Part I** to build your foundation
* Do **Chapters 3–5** from **Part II** to learn the core generative techniques
* Jump to **Chapter 9** from **Part III** to understand Transformers

You can always revisit the rest of the chapters later once you're more comfortable.

## After This

You're ready to move on to Step 2.
