## What Is ChatGPT or Gemini?

Nowadays, almost everyone has heard the names **ChatGPT** or **Gemini** and many people use them in their daily lives. But what exactly are these tools?\
\
At a high level, ChatGPT or Gemini is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model trained on massive amounts of text data. This training allows the model to generate new, human-like text based on the context it's given.

### The Meaning Behind “Generative Pretrained Transformer”

Digging a bit deeper, **ChatGPT** stands for **Chat - Generative Pretrained Transformer**. Let’s break that down:

* **Generative**: This refers to AI models that focus on _**generating**_ new data (like text, images, video, or even audio), rather than **classifying** data. For example, while a discriminative model might tell you whether a sentence is grammatically correct, a generative model can write an entirely new sentence for you.
* **Pretrained Transformer**: This means the model is built using the **Transformer** architecture (a neural network model introduced in 2017) and has been **pretrained** on a massive corpus of text before being fine-tuned for specific tasks like chatting, summarization, or translation.

## What You Need to Learn

So, to truly understand how ChatGPT and similar tools work, you'll need to get familiar with two key areas:

1. **Generative Deep Learning Foundation**
2. **Pretrained Transformer**, which are the backbone of today’s Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT.

This article is your beginner-friendly guide to understanding the core ideas behind Generative Deep Learning and Large Language Models. This article assumes your familiarity with the concept of Deep Learning.
