    "In this chapter, we introduce methods for determining whether there is a linear correlation, or association, between two numerical variables. In the case it exists, we learn how to derive a linear model and how to use it for prediction, which is very important in applications of many different fields from Business and Finance to Biology and Medicine.\n",

    "* Based on income, consumer debt, and several other predictors about a person, we might be interested in predicting a person's credit rating.\n",
